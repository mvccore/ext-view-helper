 * - Every time, when there is necessary to create view helper, there is called
 *   `\MvcCore\Ext\Views\Helpers\IHelper::GetInstance();` method in `\MvcCore\View`.
 *   All view helpers are stored inside `\MvcCore\View` and they are created only once.
 *   But if you need to configure view helper anytime before, you can use this method
 *   for singleton instancing to configure anything statically anytime before.
 * - Every time, when currently rendered view object is changed (action view, layout view,
 *   sub-controller view...), there is called `\MvcCore\Ext\Views\Helpers\IHelper::SetView($view);`
 *   method giving currently rendered view object. From this object, you can get properties
 *   for better view helper processing like application object, controller, request or response object.
